    <p>This is paragraph</p>

    <p>This tag in HTML is used to define a paragraph of text. It helps in displaying content in a clean and organized format on a webpage.
    Whenever you want to write normal text, the paragraph tag is the simplest and most commonly used option.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Browsers automatically add some space before and after every paragraph created using this tag. 
    This spacing improves readability and separates one block of text from another without writing extra CSS or code.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>The paragraph tag is a block-level element, which means it always starts on a new line. No matter where you place it in your HTML file, 
    the browser will show it as a separate block, making it ideal for writing structured content.</p>
